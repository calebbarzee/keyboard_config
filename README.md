# Caleb's Corne Config
This is the zmk config repo for firmware for a wireless Corne keyboard w/ addressable LEDs and OLED display

## Flashing
I think to put the NRF5280 (whatever the pro-micro board is), into bootload state you have to press the button twice in quick succession

## OLED Display
size = 128 px * 32 px


## TODO:
- [ ] add back in backlight config
- [ ] fix LED config, figure out declaration needed for Zephry device tree
- [ ] make OLED animation
- [ ] find way to custom declare what should be on display
